Simple Android project consisting of a single Activity and a single Fragment.

I use this app as a way to see what order things happen in regarding Activity and Fragment
lifecycle calls during situations - Initial start up, orientation changes, app entering background,
etc.

There is a single button in the middle of the fragment. Tapping the button pushes a new instance
of the same fragment type. Tapping the button again pops the second fragment.

There is also a separate fragment layout file for landscape and portrait orientations.

More to be added as the need arises.
